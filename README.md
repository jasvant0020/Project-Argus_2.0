🎯 Face Recognition Alert & Attendance System

A modular real-time face recognition system that:

✅ Detects known faces via webcam  
- Logs attendance with confidence and timestamp  
- Sends Telegram alerts when specific people are detected  
- Avoids duplicate logs using time threshold  
- Works offline with robust encoding & caching

✅ Detects unknown persons (not in your known face list).
- Ensures each unique unknown person is logged only once every X seconds.
- Logs include:
  - Name: "UNKNOWN"
  - Timestamp
  - Confidence score
  - Snapshot saved in logs/UNKNOWN/

## 🚀 Features

- 🎥 **Real-Time Detection** using webcam
- 🧠 **Face Encoding Caching** for fast startup
- 📝 **Attendance Logging** to `assets/Attendance.csv`
- ⏱️ **Time Gap Protection**: Avoids repeating logs within 5 minutes per person
- 📈 **Confidence-Based Updates**: Higher-confidence detection updates older entry
- 📩 **Telegram Alert Notification** on specific names
- 🔊 **Alert Sound** when target person is detected
- 📸 Snapshot Logging: Saves full webcam frame + metadata when target person is detected
  - This helps in **post-review** or **evidence logging** of detected persons.





## 🧠 How It Works

✅ If Detects known faces via webcam 
1. Face images in `ImagesAttendance/` are encoded using `face_recognition`
2. Encodings are cached to `encodings/encodings.pkl`
3. `main.py` reads webcam frames and runs recognition
4. If person detected:
   - Logs entry in CSV (once per 5 minutes or if confidence is higher)
   - Sends Telegram alert if person is in your `TARGET_NAMES` list
   - Plays alert sound

✅ If Detects unknown persons (not in your known face list).
1. When a face doesn't match known encodings, its face encoding is compared to previously seen unknowns using a distance threshold.
2. If it's a new unknown person, it will be logged and snapshot will be saved.
3. If it's a known unknown, it will only be logged again after a gap of X seconds (configurable).
4. This prevents duplicate logging of the same person while allowing others to be logged immediately.

### 📸 Snapshot Logging on Detection

For every detection of a person in `TARGET_NAMES`, the system:

- Saves the **entire webcam frame** (not just the face)
- Stores the frame in: `logs/<PERSON_NAME>/last_seen.jpg`
- Saves metadata like:
  - `object_id` (internal ID)
  - `timestamp`
  - `bbox` (bounding box of the face inside frame)

🗂 Example folder:

    logs/
    └── JASVANT/
        ├── last_seen.jpg    # full webcam frame at detection time
        └── meta.json        # info about detection



## 📸 Image Requirements

- Place clear, front-facing images in `ImagesAttendance/`
- File name should be the person's name (e.g., `Elon Musk.jpg`)
- Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`



## ⚙️ Configuration

### 🎯 Target Person(s) for Alert
Edit this in `main.py`:
```python
TARGET_NAMES = ["ELON MUSK", "JASVANT"]
```
## 📲 Telegram Alert Setup
```In notifier.py, replace:
BOT_TOKEN = "your_bot_token"
CHAT_ID = "your_chat_id"
```
- Use `BotFather` to create a bot and get a token
- Use `@userinfobot` to get your Chat ID



⏱️ Attendance Time Gap
```In attendance.py, change:
TIME_GAP_MINUTES = 5  # prevents frequent logging
```


## 🔊 Alert Sound
- Place your sound in assets/alert.mp3
- Must be in .mp3 format
- It will play when a target person is detected



## 📦 Installation
```🐍 1. Clone and Set Up Virtual Environment
git clone https://github.com/yourname/FaceRecognitionProject
cd FaceRecognitionProject
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```
```📦 2. Install Python Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If face_recognition or dlib fails:
- Use Python 3.10 or earlier for best compatibility



## ▶️ Running the Project
```
python main.py
```
- Press Q to exit the webcam
- Check attendance logs in assets/Attendance.csv



## 💡Tips
- Make sure lighting is good when capturing new face images
- Restart main.py after adding new images to generate encodings
- Add multiple names to TARGET_NAMES for multi-alerts
- Use .env file for storing secrets securely (optional)


## 🔐 Dependencies
```
face_recognition
opencv-python
numpy
pygame
requests
dlib (via face_recognition)
```
Install all with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 🔧 Environment Setup (Summary)
Project Argus relies on the `face_recognition` library, which has some setup requirements on Windows (especially for dlib).

To avoid common installation issues, follow this guide before running the project:

- Use Python 3.6–3.10
- Set up a virtual environment
- Install CMake and Visual Studio C++ Build Tools
- Install `dlib==19.24.2` and then `face_recognition`

## 📈 Example Attendance Entry
```
Name,Timestamp,Confidence
ELON MUSK,2025-08-02 16:40:09,91.34
```
